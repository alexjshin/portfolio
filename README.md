## Alex Shin's Portfolio

link to deployed portfolio: [https://alexshinportfolio.vercel.app/](https://alexshinportfolio.vercel.app/)

## Frameworks Used
This portfolio webapp was built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and a little bit of Chakra UI (although I realized some components are impossible to style making it useless in certain cases)

Fun Fact!
There is a light and dark mode for my portfolio, just click the moon icon in the top right corner next to the resume button. I set the default to be the dark mode because I think it looks cooler. Enjoy!
